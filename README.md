## 3. What I learned?

- OOPs
  - I learned the way to structure mothods in classes.
  - codes are more modular and easier to maintain.
  - I learned how to use classes and objects to manage data and functionality.

- module in python
  - I learned how to create my own module and use it in the main file.
  - I learned how to import module in the main file.
  - I learned how to use function, class and variable in the other module file.
- list in python as database
  - I learned how to use list as a database to store data.
